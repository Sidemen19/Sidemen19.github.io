My website's been a lot of places through the past year. From vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, to Hugo, to Nuxt, then Gatsby and finally Next.js, here's what I looked for in my *dream* website.

## Vanilla HTML
This is where most developers start off, making a static site with nothing but vanilla HTML, CSS and JS; so I thought I would fit in the crowd and do the same. I hated it. Everytime I got something looking decent on desktop, it would look horrible on mobile. I just wasn't patient enough to cater for both views on my own. This is when I began exploring for solutions where I could just focus on the content and the general layout of each page so I wouldn't need to worry about finnicky styles for responsiveness and accessibility.

This site lasted about a week, before I got annoyed looking at it on my mobile device. Rating: 1.5/5.

## Hugo
I saw a couple other people's websites, and saw "Made with Hugo" at the bottom of it. I researched on Hugo and static site generators, and thought of two things. One - everything is already done for you, as you use themes, and two - you don't get much control if you want to alter something, even ever so slightly. Despite that, I saw and picked the `Coder` theme as it supported light and dark theme, supported social media icons and supported a (rather ugly looking) blog.
I had a school project relating to website design, so I hosted my business' information on a blog post, and I'd say most were impressed. Though, as time passed I was bored from the rather boring layout of the website. I decided to switch, and code my website using a **framework**.

This site lasted about a month. Rating: 2.5/5.

## Nuxt
Moving on to website frameworks, I did my research on which to pick. Angular was out of the question, too complicated for a simple website, so that left me with Vue.js and React. Most comparison sites came to a conclusion that Vue.js was more beginner-friendly, so I picked Vue and Nuxt.js as its framework.
Nuxt looked great at first glance of its documentation, it offered much more than I could ever provide with just HTML or Hugo. As I completely abhor CSS and styling, I decided to use TailwindCSS, to make my life just a little bit easier. I built an About page, a blog and an authentication system, just for fun.
I liked that I could do pretty much anything with this site than I could, but I wasn't productive enough with Vue's weird syntax, I wanted to write JavaScript with my HTML, i.e. **JSX**! So, I switched my website's framework to React.

Ironically, I never published this site to the WWW, I was too busy building it :>). Rating: 4.5/5.

## Gatsby
What I knew from the start is my site *needed* to be static, I had a budget of $0. Gatsby looked like a good solution, and I picked it. I once read "The plugin system is both a blessing and a curse, honestly" in a Discord server, I agreed wholeheartedly with that. I spent a day just configuring and exploring plugins, and learning how to use GraphQL.
What I didn't like about Gatsby is that it almost *forced* you to use specific tools, even if you weren't comfortable with them. GraphQL was one of these, I just didn't want to write it in my components.

I gave up building this site with Gatsby halfway through, I realised I was just wasting time with it. Rating 2/5.

## Next.js
Next.js, along with Vercel hosting, seemed too good to be true. I got everything I needed from it: easy routing, JSX (thanks to React), better SEO and ability to do whatever. The community is great, with loads of useful "plugins" out there. I most enjoyed using `next-auth`, for the [GWD form](/games).
As I've said multiple times before, I suck at styling, so I used [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) for some hot components.

My current site is built with Next.js, and I endeavour to keep it that way :). Rating: 5/5.

## Conclusion
My personal favourite framework/technology was and is Next.js. It provides so much, for free! You can even build your own API with it. Some may say that frameworks are overkill and you should stick to vanilla HTML, I beg to differ :).
