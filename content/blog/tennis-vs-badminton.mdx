Tennis and badminton are two very similar sports. They both have racquets, a court, a net and singles and doubles formats.
But mentally and physically, they're both vastly different sports.
I myself have played tennis for around seven years, and badminton for around three years.
Here's what I think.

## Racquets
It's common knowledge that the two sports both feature racquets as the primary piece of equipment required to play the sport.
But what's easier to hit with?
Well, the answer here might seem obvious, badminton racquets are lighter, so it must be it!
Many people forget the fact that badminton racquets' heads are also smaller, which makes it harder to hit the shuttlecock than it is to hit a tennis ball with a tennis racquet.
This makes it much more common to frame the shuttlecock in a badminton game than in tennis.
