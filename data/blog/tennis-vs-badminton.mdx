Tennis and badminton are two very similar sports. They both have racquets, a court, a net and singles and doubles formats.
But mentally and physically, they're both vastly different sports.
I myself have played tennis for around seven years, and badminton for around three years.
Here's what I think.

## Racquets
It's common knowledge that the two sports both feature racquets as the primary piece of equipment required to play the sport.
But what's easier to hit with?
Well, the answer here might seem obvious, badminton racquets are lighter, so it must be it!
Many people forget the fact that badminton racquets' heads are also smaller, which makes it harder to hit the shuttlecock than it is to hit a tennis ball with a tennis racquet.
This makes it much more common to frame the shuttlecock in a badminton game than in tennis.
Depending on the skill levels of the players, this may be a good or bad thing, but it is mostly the latter.

## Court
The entire tennis court's area is 195.7 square metres, while the entire badminton court's area is 81.75 square metres.
While you may think, "wow! tennis must be tiring to cover that distance!", the distance travelled in both games is very similar.
That said, tennis rallies last for much longer and shots are often pushed to the sides of the court, which is very tiring.
Badminton, on the other hand, have shorter but more intense rallies across the court.

## Net
The net is not a huge factor in the comparison but is an important one.
The net is much higher in badminton, than in tennis.
This can be both a good and a bad thing.
Beginners often have trouble with tennis' sideways hitting motion, whereas in badminton it is a simple overhead swing.
Though, there are obvious situations in which a lower net is suitable, of course.

## Format
Badminton and tennis both have singles (men's, women's) and doubles (men's, women's, mixed) for social and competitive play.
Singles matches are, revenue-wise, much more popular than doubles matches in tennis.
It is the opposite in badminton as doubles' games are usually more interesting to watch.
Tennis and badminton are similar in formats in that in singles matches, players are mainly supposed to place the shuttle/ball around the opponent's court side in attempt to run and tire them out.
In doubles, more smashing shots are placed, in order to kill the rally fast and win the point.
Tennis matches are played in sets of six games, with most matches being best of three.
Badminton matches follow a similar format, with best of three sets and each set being first to 21 points.

## Career
It is definitely advisable to look towards tennis rather than badminton for a professional career.
There are several reasons to this.

The prize money for tennis is much higher than prize money for badminton, even as much as 15x higher.
The primary reason for this is popularity, tennis is a huge sport while badminton is not.
Advertisements are worth more and more money is invested into tournaments.

If popularity is a thing you'd like in your career, badminton isn't a nice choice.
I surveyed a group of people on which names they have heard in their life time.
90% of the group knew of Roger Federer, 70% knew of Serena Williams, and a whopping 0% had ever heard of Lee Chong Wei, the highest paid badminton player.
I'm going to be fair and state that not even I knew of Lee Chong Wei before I started playing badminton, but that isn't really a statement.

Just finding tournaments for badminton in smaller cities or generally just Western countries is a hard task.
As with the disadvantages of being a smaller sport, where I live, there are pretty much only tournaments at the end of the year.
You will find yourself travelling across the entire state or even country for badminton tournaments, whereas tennis tournaments are easily accessible everywhere.


## Final verdict
Badminton and tennis each have their own advantages and disadvantages in gameplay.
If you are reading this, wondering which sport to choose, I strongly suggest trying the sports yourself.
If you currently feel comfortable to do that, watch match videos on YouTube!
As for my personal thoughts, badminton is a much more enjoyable sport if you're looking towards social and fun play.
Professional players are most likely better suited towards the niceties of tennis.
Thanks for reading!
