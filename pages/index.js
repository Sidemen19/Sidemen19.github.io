                    About Me
                </h2>
                <p className="prose text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2">
                    Hey! I'm Lavya and I'm a high school student located in Newcastle, a city two hours away from Sydney, Australia.
                    Apart from my school studies, I am enrolled in my local university, the University of Newcastle, for a high-performing students program.
                    Out of options including design and medicine courses, I chose a course I was very interested in completing - Object Oriented Programming.
                    <br /><br />
                    To remain in shape, I play badminton üè∏ three times a week. Badminton was one of the first sports I picked up alongside soccer, rugby and tennis.
                    Due to court availability changes, I dropped badminton and started playing tennis, in which I engaged with many tournaments around the city and earned a A$100 prize.
                    In that time, new badminton courts had been made (and coincidentally the tennis courts' owners lost their lease!), so I started playing the sport again and I'm loving it.
                    <br /><br />
                    For my hobby, I develop software to help myself and others in their daily lives.
                    Why did I start writing code?
                    Just to have the freedom.
                    The freedom of being able to maintain a presence on the internet and automate the tedious tasks you carry out everyday, for free.
                    In fact, I created this website with no advertisements and on a custom domain without paying a cent.
