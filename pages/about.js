					Hey! I'm Lavya and I'm a high school student located in Newcastle, a city two hours away from
					Sydney, Australia.
					Apart from my school studies, I am enrolled in my local university, the University of Newcastle, for
					a high-performing students program.
					Out of options including design and medicine courses, I chose a course I was very interested in
					completing - Object Oriented Programming.
					<br /><br />
					To remain in shape, I play badminton üè∏ three times a week. Badminton was one of the first sports I
					picked up alongside soccer, rugby and tennis.
					Due to court availability changes, I dropped badminton and started playing tennis, in which I
					engaged with many tournaments around the city and earned a A$100 prize.
					In that time, new badminton courts had been made (and coincidentally the tennis courts' owners lost
					their lease!), so I started playing the sport again and I'm loving it.
					<br /><br />
					For my hobby, I develop software to help myself and others in their daily lives.
					Why did I start writing code?
					Just to have the freedom.
					The freedom of being able to maintain a presence on the internet and automate the tedious tasks you
					carry out everyday, for free.
					In fact, I created this website with no advertisements and on a custom domain without paying a cent.
